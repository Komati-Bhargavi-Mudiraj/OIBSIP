            <p>Mahesh Babu established "Mahesh Babu Foundation" to improve the lives of underprivileged children and communities. The foundation primarily focuses on supporting children in need by funding life-saving congenital heart surgeries. The foundation also co-runs the charitable trust and non-profit organisation "Heal A Child" in collaboration with Andhra Hospitals and Rainbow Hospitals. It also recognises the importance of education and provides scholarships to meritorious students from underprivileged backgrounds.</p>
            <p>Recognizing the need for holistic development, the Mahesh Babu Foundation adopted two villages, Burripalem in Andhra Pradesh and Siddhapuram in Telangana. In these villages, the foundation has undertaken various initiatives to improve the quality of life, including constructing schools, Anganwadi buildings, libraries, roads, and drainage systems. Additionally, they have established computer labs to equip villagers with crucial digital skills. The foundation also conducts regular medical checkups, distributes medicines to those in need, and has fully vaccinated the entire population of the adopted villages against COVID-19. Through health awareness programs, the foundation strives to empower villagers to make informed decisions about their well-being.</p>
            <p>Babu has also supported AIG Hospitals' "End Corona Campaign", which was aimed at creating awareness about the COVID-19 vaccine. It was one of the world's largest virtual awareness campaigns on the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
            <p>He was signed in 2013 as the goodwill ambassador of Heal-a-child Foundation, a non-profit organisation that offers financial support to the parents of terminally ill children to help with the cost of medical treatment. Babu gives 30% of his annual income to charities, and most of his philanthropic activities are unpublicised because he prefers them to be so. He joined Farhan Akhtar's Men Against Rape and Discrimination (MARD) campaign in August 2013 and lent his voice to the Telugu version of a poem written by Javed Akhtar. In October 2014, he donated â‚¹25 lakh to a relief fund run by the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh for reconstruction of areas destroyed during Cyclone Hudhud.</p>
